   <span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;">For acquiring knowledge and increasing merit, there is no other alternative of library. Thus the college has a rich library. Students use the library in the break time and they can take book from the library using their library card. The library is enriched with newspapers, magazines, periodicals along with textual, co-textual, story, novel and general knowledge books besides the text books.</span><br> <br>
